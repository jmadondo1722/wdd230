            <b>Union Buildings, South Africa's administrative capital.</b>
            <br><br>Pretoria is South Africa's administrative capital,serving as the seat of the executive branch of
            government, and as the host to all foreign embassies to SouthAfrica.Pretoria straddles the Apies River and
            extends eastward into the foothills of the Magaliesberg mountains. It has a reputation as an academic city
            and
            center of research, being home to the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), the University of Pretoria
            (UP), the University of South Africa (UNISA), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and
            the Human Sciences Research Council. It also hosts the
            National Research Foundation and the South African Bureau of Standards. Pretoria was one of the host cities
            of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
            <br><br>

            <hr><br><b> City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality</b><br>
            Pretoria is the central part of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality which was formed by the
            amalgamation of several former local authorities, including Bronkhorstspruit, Centurion, Cullinan,
            Hammanskraal and Soshanguve. Some have proposed changing the official name from Pretoria to Tshwane, which
            has caused some public controversy. Pretoria is named after the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, and
            South Africans sometimes call it
            the "Jacaranda City", because of the thousands of jacaranda trees planted along its streets and in its
            parks and gardens.<br><br><hr>

            <br><b>Demographics and Population</b><br>
            Depending on the extent of the area understood to constitute "Pretoria", the population ranges from
            700,000 to 2.95 million.The main languages spoken in Pretoria are Sepedi, Setswana, Xitsonga,
            Afrikaans and English. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since
            its founding, it has been a major Afrikaner population centre, and there are roughly 1 million Afrikaners
            living in or around the city.<br><br>

            <br><b>Ethnic Groups</b><br>
            Even since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself has had a white majority, albeit with an ever-increasing
            black middle-class. However, in the townships of Mamelodi, Soshanguve and Atteridgeville black people make
            up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the Afrikaners and the largest black
            ethnic group are the Northern Sothos. The lower estimate for the population of Pretoria includes largely
            former white-designated areas, and there
            is therefore a white majority. However, including the geographically separate townships increases Pretoria's
            population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.Pretoria's Indians were ordered to move from
            Pretoria to Laudium on 6 June 1958.<br><br><hr>

            <br><b>Pretoria City Size and Density</b><br>
            The city of Pretoria occupies 687.54 kilometers squared (265.46 square miles). The population density comes
            to approximately 1,100 residents per square kilometer (2,800 residents per square mile).

            <br><b>Union Buildings Tours</b>
            <br>The neoclassical Union Buildings house Pretoria’s government headquarters and presidential offices.
            Designed in 1908, the sandstone wings represent South Africa’s Afrikaners and English people—joined by a
            central courtyard. While the building isn’t open to the public, you can always enjoy the surrounding gardens
            and statues.

            <br><br>Boost your knowledge of Pretoria’s past and tick off some of its most important landmarks without
            putting in any trip research time, thanks to this comprehensive guided tour. Transport in an air-conditioned
            vehicle is included to speed up your sightseeing, and stops on the itinerary include the Voortrekker
            Monument, the Kruger House Museum, and the Union Buildings.

            <br><b>Where is Pretoria?</b><br>
            Pretoria is situated approximately 55 km (34 mi) north-northeast of Johannesburg in the northeast of South
            Africa, in a transitional belt between the plateau of the Highveld to the south and the lower-lying Bushveld
            to the north. It lies at an altitude of about 1,339 m (4,393 ft) above sea level, in a warm, sheltered,
            fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the Magaliesberg range.<br><hr>

            <br><b>Climate</b>
            Pretoria has a subtropical monsoon climate (Köppen: Cwa) with long hot rainy summers, and short, dry and
            mild winters. The city experiences the typical winters of South Africa with cold, clear nights and mild to
            moderately warm days. Although the average lows during winter are mild, it can get cold due to the clear
            skies, with night time low temperatures in recent years in the range of 2 to −5 °C (36 to 23 °F).

            <br><br>The average annual temperature is 18.7 °C (65.7 °F).[13] This is rather high, considering the city's
            relatively high altitude of about 1,339 metres (4,393 feet), and is due mainly to its sheltered valley
            position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for
            much of the year.

            <br><br>Rain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the
            winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in
            1959, 1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history.
            <hr>

            <br><b>History</b><br>Pretoria was founded in 1855 by Marthinus Pretorius, a leader of the Voortrekkers, who
            named it
            after his father Andries Pretorius and chose a spot on the banks of the Apies rivier (Afrikaans for "Monkeys
            river") to be the new capital of the South African Republic (Dutch: Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek; ZAR). The
            elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the Voortrekkers after his victory over Dingane and the Zulus
            in the Battle of Blood River in 1838. The elder Pretorius also negotiated the Sand River Convention (1852),
            in which the United Kingdom acknowledged the independence of the Transvaal. It became the capital of the
            South African Republic on 1 May 1860.

            <br><br>The founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end
            of the Boers' settlement movements of the Great Trek.

            <hr><br><b>Languages</b><br>The primary language spoken in the area is Afrikaans. Other languages include Sepedi, Xitsonga,
            Sesotho and English, amongst others. The religion is varied across the area, and Pretoria is the site of
            churches, mosques, synagogues and a Jewish temple. In addition to being the seat of the country’s executive
            branch of government, the de facto capital city also hosts foreign embassies, and has the second largest
            number of embassies in the world behind the United States. The city is the site of many official government
            offices, including the office of South Africa’s president, which is located in the Union Building. Pretoria
            is considered a major commercial and industrial center, and its main industries include manufacturing in
            railroads, automobile and machinery and iron and steel casting.<hr>
